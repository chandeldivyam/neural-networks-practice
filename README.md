# Neural Networks Practice

This repository contains practice code following along with Andrej Karpathy's YouTube playlist on Neural Networks.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to setup and run the project:

1. **Setup Virtual Environment**

    Create a virtual environment using the venv module:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

    Activate the virtual environment. On Windows, use:

    ```bash
    .\env\Scripts\activate
    ```

    On Unix or MacOS, use:

    ```bash
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install Requirements**

    Install the required packages using the requirements.txt file:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run Jupyter Notebook**

    Run Jupyter notebook on the required port 8999:

    ```bash
    jupyter-lab --port 8999
    ```

Now, you should be able to open the notebook in your browser and run the code.
